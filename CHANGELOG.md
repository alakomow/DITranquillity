# 4.6.0
* Support Variadic types/generics: https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0398-variadic-types.md
Now register and injection have infinity paramaters.
* Improve changes from 4.3.4 release. Now your can simplify use two modificators:
Old: `container.register { Cat(name: arg($0), owner: many($1), home: $2) }`
New: `container.register(Cat.init) { (arg($0), many($1)) }`

# 4.5.1-4.5.2
* Add `unused` for components. Need for disable warning for optional components.

# 4.5.0
* Add `root` components. For more information see `registration_and_service.md`

* Remove SpinLock

# 4.3.5

# 4.3.3
* Fix argument injection for Tag and named resolve.

# v4.3.0
Warning! This version change public API!
